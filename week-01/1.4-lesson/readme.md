## Introduction: Lists and Dictionaries (10 mins)

In our last lesson, we went over the six Python data types.

<details>
<summary>
What were they?
</summary>
```bash
- Integers
- Floats
- Strings
- Tuples
- Lists
- Dictionaries
```
</details>

Lists and dictionaries are the most fundamental data structures in Python. In this lesson, we'll be learning to create and perform operations on them.

Turn and Talk: Work in pairs and white table the definitions of list and dictionary.

<details>
<summary>
Lists
</summary>
```bash
- A collection of values
- Can be changed; not fixed
- Each value has a number associated with it, starting at 0
- Denoted by square brackets
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Dictionaries
</summary>
```bash
- A collection of key and value pairs
- Keys are unique, values are not
- Values can be of any data type, but keys must be immutable types (integer, string, tuple)
- No specific order of key, value pairs
```
</details>

## Guided Practice: Lists (30 mins)

Lists are similar to tuples.

<details>
<summary>
Why would we use a list over a tuple?
</summary>
```bash
- Lists are modifiable, tuples are fixed.
- Most of the time we use lists, not tuples, because we want to easily change the values of things if we need to.
```
</details>

Say you have FIVE friends named Skeeter, Patty, Roger, Bebe and Porkchop. Let's create a list.

How do we create a list?

<details>
<summary>
In the Python shell type:
</summary>
```bash
friends = ['Skeeter', 'Patty', 'Roger', 'Bebe', 'Porkchop']
```
</details>

then type:
```bash
friends
```

Let's print the 3rd friend in your list.

<details>
<summary>
In the Python shell type:
</summary>
```bash
print friends[2]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>
and it returns:
</summary>
```bash
Roger
```
</details>

Let's add to the list.

In the Python shell type:
```bash
friends.append('Doug')
```

then type:
```bash
friends
```

<details>
<summary>
and it returns:
</summary>
```bash
['Skeeter', 'Patty', 'Roger', 'Bebe', 'Porkchop', 'Doug']
```
</details>

append() is what we call a method for Python. Let's play around with a couple more.

Let's remove your 4th friend using del.

<details>
<summary>
In the Python shell type:
</summary>
```bash
del friends[3]
```
</details>

then type:
```bash
friends
```

<details>
<summary>
and it returns:
</summary>
```bash
['Skeeter', 'Patty', 'Roger', 'Porkchop', 'Doug']
```
</details>

Now let's see what the pop() method does.

In the Python shell type:
```bash
friends.pop()
```
What happens when you type:
```bash
friends
```
<details>
<summary>
it returns:
</summary>
```bash
['Skeeter', 'Patty', 'Roger', 'Porkchop']
```
</details>

## Demo: Dictionaries (30 mins)

Now you have a list of your friends, but let's say you want to store their birthday information to retrieve at another time.

You can't do this with a list. Here's where dictionaries come into play.



A list won't
do, you need to associate your friends with their phone numbers. You need a telephone
book. For this we need a dictionary. We know that dictionaries have keys and values.
In other words, your friends' names would be the keys and their phone numbers
would be the values.

When you initially create a dictionary, it is very much like making a tuple or list.
Tuples have ( and ) things, lists have [ and ] things. Guess what! dictionaries
have { and } things - curly braces.

In Jupyter notebook type:
```bash
# Make the phone book:
phonebook = {'Curly':123456, 'Moe':789012, 'Larry':345678, 'Tweedle Dee':901234, 'Tweedle Dumb':567890}
```

then type:
```bash
phonebook
```

and it returns:
```bash
{'Curly': 123456,
 'Larry': 345678,
 'Moe': 789012,
 'Tweedle Dee': 901234,
 'Tweedle Dumb': 567890}
```

Let's add a new friend to the phonebook.
In Jupyter notebook type:
```bash
phonebook['Humpty Dumpty'] = 234567
```

then type:
```bash
phonebook
```

and it returns:
```bash
{'Curly': 123456,
 'Humpty Dumpty': 234567,
 'Larry': 345678,
 'Moe': 789012,
 'Tweedle Dee': 901234,
 'Tweedle Dumb': 567890}
```

Let's delete a friend to the phonebook.
In Jupyter notebook type:
```bash
del phonebook['Curly']
```

then type:
```bash
phonebook
```

and it returns:
```bash
{'Humpty Dumpty': 234567,
 'Larry': 345678,
 'Moe': 789012,
 'Tweedle Dee': 901234,
 'Tweedle Dumb': 567890}
```

Let's create a new dictionary with nothing in it to start with:
In Jupyter notebook type:
```bash
ages = {}
```

Now, let's add some names and ages to the dictionary.
```bash
ages['Humpty Dumpty'] = 23
ages['Larry'] = 19
ages['Moe'] = 78
ages['Tweedle Dee'] = 45
```

[Dictionaries](http://sthurlow.com/python/lesson06/)

**Check**:
() are used for tuples, lists, or dictionaries?
[] are used for tuples, lists, or dictionaries?
{} are used for tuples, lists, or dictionaries?

## Independent Practice: Topic (5 minutes)
Suggestions:
Create your own dictionary
Return only one element in the dictionary
Add/delete something to the dictionary

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion (10 mins)
- Partner up and explain what a list and a dictionary are to your partners
- What are the differences between a list and a dictionary?
- What are the two things you need for a dictionary?
