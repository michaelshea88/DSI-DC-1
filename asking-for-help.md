# Asking For Help

## In Class
Write down your question on your desktop with a marker and then get back to what's going on in class. This is a good way not to forget your question, but also not disrupt the flow of class. We will be doing a lot of pairing and/or group exercises in class. During these exercises is the perfect time to ask fellow students your question. Slack it out to all of them in the parking lot channel. If it's still unclear, try the steps below after class. This isn't meant to discourage questions, but to keep a good flow in the classroom.

## During Normal Weeks

Please make sure to read the [squad meetings guidelines](squad meetings.md)!

Outside of squad meetings, you can always ask any instructor any question over the course of the day. If we're not around, please send one of us a Slack message -- we all live and breathe Slack!

We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions, e.g. "Why isn't my code working?"

1. Try something else
2. Look at Google
3. Look at the lesson plan
4. Ask another classmate
5. Ask an instructor

If we get the impression that you haven't tried the first three steps, we may push back and redirect you to Google, an article, or a lesson plan. It's not that we're mean or that we're too busy: We try hard to not just give anyone answers because that's not a sustainable approach to learning data science. You will have to seek out answers on your own first, both here and in the real data science world!

If it's clear that you've made a concerted effort to research the problem, then we'll be more than happy to help you figure things out. Usually the first question we'll ask is "What errors are you getting?"

If your question is **non-technical** -- you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt -- we'll do our best to address your concerns as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

**After 6pm**, aside from during office hours, instructors *may not* respond to *technical* questions. This is for our work-life balance as well as yours! If you have logistical questions, such as about a homework prompt or when class is starting, please contact your squad instructor.

## Projects

Issues should be submitted on the Slack parking lot channel and should follow this format:
```
My question is about ___.
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.

```

### Why?
Many reasons! The biggest is that data scientists often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

### How?
Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue. (You can also use the handy [template](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.) above.) It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

#### Context
When submitting an issue, please provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What Project you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

#### Approaches Tried
Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

### So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
**We really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

For technical problems, seek us out in person when you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking other students for help (in-person, on Slack, etc).
